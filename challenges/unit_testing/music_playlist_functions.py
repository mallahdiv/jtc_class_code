THESE FIRST THREE FUNCTIONS ARE FROM LAST CHALLENGE
THEY SHOULD NOT NEED TO BE CHANGED

FUNCTIONS BELOW THIS POINT HAVE PROBLEMS!
'''

'''
For Question 1:
function to search songs by artist
# takes 2 arguments, playlist (list) and artist_name (a string)
# returns a list of songs in the playlist by that artist
# if there are no songs found by that artist, the list will be empty

'''
For Question 2:
Function to search songs by title
# takes 2 arguments, playlist (list) and song_title (string)
# returns a list including all the songs with the title searched
# if there are no songs with this title, the list will be empty
'''

	songs_found = []

'''
For Question 3
Function to play songs from the playlist on shuffle
-takes 1 argument, playlist (list)
-shuffles playlist and plays the first song (playlist[0])
-prints out which song is playing, and increases 'plays' for that song by 1
-no need to return anything
'''

	np.random.shuffle(playlist)
	print(f'On shuffle! Now playing {playlist[0]["title"]} by {playlist[0]["artist"]}')
	playlist[0]["plays"] +=1



'''
For BONUS Question 4
Function to remove a song from the playlist by title and artist
-takes 3 arguments, playlist(list), song_title (string), and song_artist ('string')
-if that song is in the playlist, it should remove 1 song matching that title/artist from the list
-if that song is not in the playlist, it should print out 'That song is not in your playlist!'
